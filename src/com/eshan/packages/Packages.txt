Packages:
Packages are containers of classes.
Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces.
Naming convention : name in reverse domain manner like - com.eshan.package.a etc
Packages are used for: Preventing naming conflicts.

Suppose a situation when you have classes of same name for eg.,
class Greeting {
    void printGreeting(){
        System.out.println("Good Morning");
    }
}

class Greeting {
    void printGreeting(){
        System.out.println("Hello!!");
    }
}

And your work is to call these printGreeting Methods from both Greeting class.

If you create class with same name then java will throw error stating that you cannot have classes with same names
inside a package. For this reason you have to create one Greeting in one package and other Greeting in other package
for calling that printGreeting()

Static :
Such properties that are not related to the object but common in all object of that class like population,
then those properties are static.
A static member can only access static members
